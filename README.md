# Quantitative Analysis
## Performance Analysis

The cumulative returns for each portfolio show that Algorithm 1 portfolio is in the highest standing after 5 years. Paulson & Co Inc is performing better than S&P 500, but only with a negligible amount of cumulative returns. Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Algorithm 2, Soros Fund Management LLC, and Tiger Global Management LLC follows Algorithm 1 portfolio in order with each outperforming the S&P 500.  
## Risk Analysis

Paulson & Co Inc has the smallest spread.In addition, Tiger Global Management LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc are riskier than S&P 500 according to the standard deviation calculations. 
## Rolling Statistics

According to the graph, the risk for each portfolio increases more or less at the same time as S&P 500â€™s risk was increasing.

Paulson & Co INC has the highest correlation to S&P 500, and, according to the beta calculation, it seems to be sensitive to the movements in the market as well.
## Sharpe Ratios

Using the box plot, the Algorithm strategies clearly outperforms the market. Both Algorithmic portfolios have higher returns for lower risk than S&P 500. 
# Custom Portfolio
## Performance Analysis
For the custom portfolio, I selected Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and Adobe stocks. What can I say? I am feeling great with technology companies these days.

Using the cumulative returns graph above, the cumulative returns for the custom portfolio can be seen as second to the Algorithm 2 portfolio.
## Risk Analysis

The spread is high for the custom portfolio as seen from above box plot comparison for all portfolios. Furthermore, my custom portfolio with technology companies is riskier than the market according to the standard deviation calculations. Since the cumulative returns fair well overall, custom portfolio should be considered for long-term investment strategy.
## Sharpe Ratios

Using the above box plot created from the sharpe ratio calulations, the custom strategy clearly outperforms the market. We can conclude that the higher risk of custom portfolio is justified by higher returns than the market portfolio.
